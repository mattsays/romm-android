   - **Xcode**: If you have a Mac and developer account
3. **Trust the Developer**: Go to Settings → General → VPN & Device Management → Trust the developer certificate
4. **Open the App**: Launch RomM and log in with your RomM server credentials

#### Sideloadly Setup (Recommended for iOS)
1. Download and install [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/) on your computer
2. Connect your iOS device via USB
3. Drag the downloaded IPA file into Sideloadly

## 📁 How To - Folder Management

RomM Mobile uses a sophisticated folder management system that allows you to organize your ROM files efficiently. Here's how it works:

### Overview

The app manages folders in two main ways:
- **Platform-specific folders**: Each gaming platform (NES, SNES, PlayStation, etc.) can have its own dedicated folder
- **Automatic folder selection**: When you download your first ROM for a platform, the app will prompt you to select a folder

### How Folder Management Works

#### 1. **First-time Setup**
When you download your first ROM for any platform:
1. The app checks if a folder is already configured for that platform
2. If no folder exists, it automatically prompts you to select one
3. You'll see a dialog asking you to choose a folder for that specific platform
4. Once selected, all future ROMs for that platform will be saved in the same folder

#### 2. **Folder Configuration**
- **Automatic**: Prompted when downloading first ROM of a platform
- **Manual**: Configure folders in Settings → Platform Folders
- **Per-platform**: Each platform can have its own unique folder
- **Flexible**: You can change folder locations anytime

#### 3. **Storage Access Framework (SAF)**
The app uses Android's Storage Access Framework which:
- ✅ Works with any storage location (internal, SD card, cloud storage)
- ✅ Maintains permissions across app updates
- ✅ Provides secure access to your files
- ✅ No need for broad storage permissions

### Managing Folders

#### In Settings
Navigate to **Settings → Platform Folders** to:
- View all configured platform folders
- Change folder location for any platform
- Remove folder configuration for a platform
- Remove all platform folder configurations

#### During Download
When downloading a ROM:
1. App checks if platform folder exists
2. If exists: ROM downloads directly to that folder
3. If missing: Shows folder selection dialog
4. Selected folder is saved for future downloads of that platform

#### Folder Selection Dialog
The folder selection dialog shows:
- **Current folder** (if one is already configured)
- **Platform name** you're configuring
- Options to **Change** or **Cancel**

### Key Features

#### Smart File Detection
- Automatically detects if a ROM is already downloaded
- Prevents duplicate downloads
